Feature: Search
  In order to find an item on Amazon UK
  As a customer
  I want to search for the item
  
  Background:
    Given I am on Amazon UK
    And the search bar is displayed
    When I search for ipad
    And there are search results displayed
    
  Scenario: verify that the price of the first result matches user's input
    Then the price of the first result should be £295.00
    
  Scenario: print out number of results found and assert the price of the last result
    Then the number of results displayed should more than 0
    And the price of the last result should not be £295.00
