== ScribeStar [SS] Automation Suite

== Introduction
This automation suite is aimed at assisting the ScribeStar test team in automating key feature areas to be tested within its functional and regression test process.

The suite will hybridize Capybara and Selenium-Webdriver as the automation framework with Ruby as its underlying technology.

== Objectives
The objectives of the suite or framework are outlined as follows:
    1. To optimise end-to-end functional testing.
    2. To facilitate compatibility testing across defined browsers, platforms and operating systems.
    3. To enable efficient continuous integrated [CI] regression testing of the ScribeStar application.
